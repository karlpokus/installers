# installers
Install and update stuff on my machine.

# why?
wtf would you want to maintain this? Well most package managers have outdated versions and this way it's easy to only install from a trusted source. Also most cli tools are written in go and come as a single, static binary so installing is super easy. Plus you get nice list of available versions for those that live in github.

# requirements
- github cli

# usage
Mostly `$ *.sh ls|tag` but some sources are missing a listing function.
